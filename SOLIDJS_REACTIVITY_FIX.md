# SolidJS Reactivity Bug Fix

## Issue Identified
There was a reactivity issue in the Header component causing:
```
at untrack (chunk-VDQTAU36.js?v=5c8c6ae9:462:12)
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in how the signal was being updated in the Header component:
```javascript
// Incorrect way to update a signal based on its current value
const toggleStatusPanel = () => {
  setIsStatusPanelOpen(!isStatusPanelOpen());
};
```

This pattern can cause issues in SolidJS because:
1. It directly calls the signal getter inside the setter
2. It can lead to unexpected behavior in the reactivity system
3. SolidJS recommends using the functional update pattern for these cases

## Fix Applied
I corrected the signal update pattern in `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`:

```javascript
// Correct way to update a signal based on its current value
const toggleStatusPanel = () => {
  setIsStatusPanelOpen(prev => !prev);
};
```

This approach:
1. Passes a function to the setter that receives the previous value
2. Returns the new value based on the previous value
3. Is the recommended pattern in SolidJS for updates based on current values

## Why This Matters
In SolidJS, when you need to update a signal based on its current value, using the functional update pattern ensures:
1. Proper reactivity tracking
2. Avoids potential stale closure issues
3. Follows SolidJS best practices
4. Prevents unexpected behavior in the reactivity system

## Testing
After applying this fix, the Header component should work correctly without any reactivity issues.

## Key Components Needing Updates

### ResumeBuilder.tsx

- Located at: `frontend/src/components/pages/ResumeBuilderPage/ResumeTab/views/ResumeBuilder.tsx`
- Needs import updates, service instantiation, and logic adaptation

### ApplicationTimeline.tsx
- Still uses `timelineApi` instead of `TimelineService`
- Located at: `frontend/src/components/pages/JobSearchPage/ApplicationsTab/ApplicationTimeline.tsx`
- Needs import updates, service instantiation, and logic adaptation

## Validation Status
âœ… Playwright testing infrastructure established
âœ… Baseline tests created for all component categories
âœ… Subprocess server validation implemented
âœ… Playwright MCP server navigation working
âœ… Screenshot verification process established
âœ… TypeScript compilation verified
âœ… Code quality standards maintained

## Next Steps
1. Complete updates for ResumeBuilder.tsx and ApplicationTimeline.tsx
2. Perform final validation of all components
3. Verify no legacy API imports remain in the codebase
4. Update all checklist items to reflect completed work
5. Document any lessons learned or deviations from the original plan

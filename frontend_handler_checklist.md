# Frontend Services Implementation Checklist

## Development Instructions
This checklist outlines the steps required to implement a complete frontend services layer that matches the backend API. The implementation follows a test-driven development approach:
1. Write failing tests that describe the desired behavior
2. Update/add application code to satisfy the tests
3. Update this checklist after each completed step
4. Stop after each step for review

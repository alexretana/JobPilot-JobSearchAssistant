## Validation Results
✅ All components successfully compile with TypeScript
✅ All components render correctly with service integration
✅ All user interactions work as expected
✅ No references to legacy API modules remain
✅ Consistent error handling and loading states across components
✅ Clean, maintainable code that follows established patterns
✅ Comprehensive test coverage with Playwright
✅ All tests pass with the updated components

## Verification
- Created and ran verification scripts (`verify_no_legacy_imports.sh` and `verify_no_legacy_imports.bat`)
- Both scripts confirm that no legacy API imports remain in the frontend components
- All validation processes established during the project are working correctly

## Impact
This work has successfully modernized the entire frontend architecture by:
- Eliminating all legacy API dependencies
- Establishing consistent service integration patterns across all components
- Improving code maintainability and type safety
- Setting up comprehensive testing and validation processes
- Creating detailed documentation for future reference

The frontend is now fully updated to use the new service layer architecture without any legacy dependencies.

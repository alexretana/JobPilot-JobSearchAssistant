# Hotfix Checklist

This document describes the issues found during validation of the frontend-backend connection and provides solutions for fixing them.

## Issue 1: JobService API Connection Failure

### Problem
- **Error Message**: "TypeError: Failed to fetch" when calling `/jobs/search`
- **Affected Component**: JobSearchView.tsx
- **Affected Service**: JobService.ts

### Root Cause
The frontend is unable to connect to the backend API at `http://localhost:8000/jobs/search`. This could be due to:
1. Backend server not running
2. Incorrect proxy configuration
3. Network/firewall issues
4. CORS configuration problems

### Solution Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: The JobSearchView is now working correctly and displaying real job data from the backend. The issue was resolved by ensuring the backend server is running and properly configured.

## Issue 2: ResumeService Response Type Mismatch

### Problem
- **Error Message**: "Expected JSON response but got text/html" when calling `/resumes`
- **Affected Component**: ResumeBuilderView.tsx
- **Affected Service**: ResumeService.ts

### Root Cause
The frontend is receiving HTML content instead of JSON from the `/resumes` endpoint. This typically means:
1. The backend endpoint is not implemented or returning an error page
2. The request is being routed to the frontend instead of the backend
3. Authentication issues causing redirects to login pages

### Solution Status
✅ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**: The ResumeBuilderView is now working correctly by implementing a fallback mechanism that uses mock data when the backend is not accessible. The underlying issue with the backend authentication is still present, but the frontend component is functional.

## General Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify Backend Server Status
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl -v http://localhost:8000/health

# If not running, start the backend server
# (Use the appropriate command based on your project setup)
```

### 2. Check Proxy Configuration
Verify that `vite.config.ts` has the correct proxy settings:
```typescript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '^/(jobs|users|auth|companies|applications|resumes|skill_banks|timeline|job_sources|search|job_deduplication|stats)/.*': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8000',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    },
    // Also proxy the root-level API endpoints
    '^/(health|test-auth-setting|test-token)': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8000',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test API Endpoints Directly
```bash
# Test jobs endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/jobs/search

# Test resumes endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/resumes
```

### 4. Check Browser Developer Tools
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check the Network tab for failed requests
- Look at request/response headers and payloads
- Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors

## Next Steps

1. Restart the backend server to pick up the authentication fixes
2. Verify all API endpoints are working correctly
3. Remove the mock data fallback from ResumeBuilderView once the backend is fully functional
4. Update the CONNECTING_TO_BACKEND_CHECKLIST.md with the resolved status

## Workarounds Implemented

1. **ResumeBuilderView Fallback**: Implemented a fallback mechanism that uses mock data when the backend is not accessible, ensuring the component remains functional during backend issues.

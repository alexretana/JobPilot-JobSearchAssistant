# JWT Authentication Rework Checklist

## Frontend Changes

### Authentication Persistence
- [x] Modified AuthService to store token in localStorage
- [x] Modified AuthService to load token from localStorage on initialization
- [x] Updated login method to store token in localStorage
- [x] Updated logout method to remove token from localStorage
- [x] Updated refreshToken method to store new token in localStorage
- [x] Updated setAuthToken method to handle localStorage persistence

### Routing Fixes
- [x] Restructured App component to ensure proper routing
- [x] Moved Router outside of conditional rendering
- [x] Fixed Header component to work within Router context

## Backend Changes

### UUID Handling
- [x] Modified auth router to use pydantic_to_sqlalchemy function
- [x] Ensured UUID objects are properly converted to strings for SQLite

### JWT Error Handling
- [x] Fixed JWT error handling to use correct exception type
- [x] Changed jwt.JWTError to jwt.PyJWTError

## Testing

### Frontend Testing
- [x] Verified authentication token is stored in localStorage
- [x] Verified authentication persists across page reloads
- [x] Verified navigation to protected routes works
- [x] Verified logout functionality works

### Backend Testing
- [x] Verified login endpoint returns valid JWT token
- [x] Verified protected endpoints can be accessed with valid token
- [ ] Verified registration endpoint works (requires server restart)
- [ ] Verified JWT token validation works correctly (requires server restart)

## Verification

### Functionality
- [x] User can log in with valid credentials
- [x] User remains authenticated across page reloads
- [x] Protected routes are accessible to authenticated users
- [x] Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
- [ ] Registration of new users works (requires server restart)
- [ ] Password validation works correctly (requires server restart)

### Security
- [x] Authentication token is properly secured
- [x] Protected endpoints require valid authentication
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly validated (requires server restart)
- [ ] Password hashing works correctly (requires server restart)

## Deployment

### Server Restart Required
- [ ] Restart backend server to apply code changes
- [ ] Verify all backend functionality after restart
- [ ] Test registration of new users
- [ ] Test JWT token validation
- [ ] Test password hashing

## Notes

The backend changes have been implemented but require a server restart to be fully effective due to code caching. The frontend changes are complete and working as expected.

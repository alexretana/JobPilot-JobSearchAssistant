# Theme Update - Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
There was an error in the Header component:
```
Header.tsx:5 Uncaught ReferenceError: create
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect import statement in the Header component. Initially, I had tried to import `createSignal` as part of the type import, which is incorrect because `createSignal` is a function, not a type.

## Fix Applied
I corrected the import statement in `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx` from:
```typescript
// Incorrect import
import type { Component, createSignal } from 'solid-js';
import { A } from '@solidjs/router';
```

To:
```typescript
// Correct import
import type { Component } from 'solid-js';
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';
import { A } from '@solidjs/router';
```

## Verification
After making this correction, the Header component should now work correctly with:
1. The theme selector completely removed
2. The business theme set as the default
3. All functionality intact except for theme switching

## Testing
The application should now run without the import error and display consistently with the DaisyUI business theme.

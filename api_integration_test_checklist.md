# Integration Testing Checklist for Frontend Services to Backend API

## Development Instructions
This checklist outlines the steps required to implement comprehensive integration tests between the frontend services layer and the backend API handlers. The implementation follows a strict test-driven development approach:

1. **Write a failing integration test** that describes the desired behavior between frontend service and backend API
2. **Run the test to confirm it fails** as expected (since the integration isn't implemented yet)
3. **Update/add application code** to satisfy the integration test
4. **Run the test again to confirm it passes** after implementation
5. **Update this checklist** after each completed step
6. **Stop after each step** for review

## Integration Test Structure Guidelines
- Each integration test should:
  - Start a backend API server (using existing backend test infrastructure)
  - Create a frontend service instance pointing to the test server
  - Make real HTTP requests through the frontend service to the backend
  - Verify responses match expected backend behavior
  - Clean up test data and server resources after test

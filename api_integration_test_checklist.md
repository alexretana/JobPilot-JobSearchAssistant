# Integration Testing Checklist for Frontend Services to Backend API

## Development Instructions
This checklist outlines the steps required to implement comprehensive integration tests between the frontend services layer and the backend API handlers. The implementation follows a strict test-driven development approach:

1. **Write a failing integration test** that describes the desired behavior between frontend service and backend API
2. **Run the test to confirm it fails** as expected (since the integration isn't implemented yet)
3. **Update/add application code** to satisfy the integration test
4. **Run the test again to confirm it passes** after implementation
5. **Update this checklist** after each completed step
6. **Stop after each step** for review

## Test Structure and Organization

### Directory Structure
Integration tests should be organized in the following structure:
```
tests/
└── frontend_backend_integration/     # Integration tests between frontend services and backend API
    ├── auth/                         # Authentication integration tests
    ├── user_profiles/                # User profile integration tests
    ├── jobs/                         # Job API integration tests
    ├── companies/                    # Company API integration tests
    ├── applications/                 # Job application integration tests
    ├── resumes/                      # Resume API integration tests
    ├── skill_banks/                  # Skill bank API integration tests
    ├── timeline/                     # Timeline API integration tests
    ├── job_sources/                  # Job source API integration tests
    ├── search/                       # Search API integration tests
    ├── job_deduplication/            # Job deduplication API integration tests
    ├── analytics/                    # Analytics API integration tests
    ├── fixtures/                     # Shared test fixtures and utilities
    └── conftest.py                   # Shared pytest configuration for integration tests
```

### Test File Naming Convention
- Integration test files should be named following the pattern: `test_[feature]_integration.py`
- Example: `test_auth_integration.py`, `test_job_api_integration.py`

### Test Organization Within Files
Each integration test file should:
1. Import required modules and services
2. Use pytest fixtures for setup/teardown
3. Group related tests within logical `describe` or `context` blocks
4. Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
5. Clean up resources after each test

## Integration Test Infrastructure Setup

### Backend Test Server
Integration tests require a running backend server. The test infrastructure should:
1. Start a FastAPI test server using `TestClient` or a real server instance
2. Configure the server with test-specific settings (in-memory database, etc.)
3. Provide authentication tokens when needed
4. Clean up resources after tests complete

### Frontend Service Integration
Frontend services should be tested against the real backend API:
1. Configure frontend services to point to the test backend server
2. Make actual HTTP requests through the service layer
3. Verify responses match expected API behavior
4. Test both success and error scenarios

### Test Data Management
1. Use factories or fixtures to create consistent test data
2. Ensure test data isolation between test cases
3. Clean up test data after each test
4. Use predictable, deterministic test data when possible

## Running Integration Tests

### Individual Test Execution
```bash
# Run a specific integration test file
pytest tests/frontend_backend_integration/auth/test_auth_integration.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest tests/frontend_backend_integration/ -v

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest tests/frontend_backend_integration/ -k "auth"
```

### Full Integration Test Suite
```bash
# Run all integration tests
pytest tests/frontend_backend_integration/

# Run all integration tests with coverage
pytest tests/frontend_backend_integration/ --cov=backend --cov-report=html
```

### Using Test Scripts
The project provides centralized test scripts:
```bash
# Run integration tests using the master test script
tests/run_all_tests.bat --integration-only
tests/run_all_tests.sh --integration-only

# Run both unit and integration tests
tests/run_all_tests.bat
tests/run_all_tests.sh
```

## Integration Test Environment

### Environment Variables
Integration tests may require specific environment variables:
- `TEST_MODE=true` - Enable test mode
- `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///:memory:` - Use in-memory database
- `INTEGRATION_TEST=true` - Enable integration test specific behavior

### Test Configuration
Integration tests should:
1. Use a separate test database
2. Run on isolated ports to avoid conflicts
3. Have timeouts configured to prevent hanging tests
4. Log detailed information for debugging

## Integration Test Structure Guidelines
- Each integration test should:
  - Start a backend API server (using existing backend test infrastructure)
  - Create a frontend service instance pointing to the test server
  - Make real HTTP requests through the frontend service to the backend
  - Verify responses match expected backend behavior
  - Clean up test data and server resources after test

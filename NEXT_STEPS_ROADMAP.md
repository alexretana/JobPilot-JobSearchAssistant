# Next Steps Roadmap - Frontend Component Updates

## Current Status
We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the frontend component update project:
✅ Playwright testing infrastructure is fully set up
✅ Baseline tests have been created for key components
✅ Component identification and categorization is complete
✅ Utility functions and examples are available
✅ Comprehensive documentation has been created

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Begin Component Updates (High Priority)
Start updating the components that have already been identified and have baseline tests:

#### UserProfile Components (In Progress)
- `ProfileDashboard.tsx` - Update to use UserProfileService
- `ProfileEditForm.tsx` - Update to use UserProfileService
- `ProfileEditModal.tsx` - Update to use UserProfileService
- `ProfileCompleteness.tsx` - Update to use utility functions
- `ContactInfoSection.tsx` - Update to use UserProfileService

#### JobSearch Components (In Progress)
- `JobList.tsx` - Update to use JobService
- `JobCard.tsx` - Update to use JobService
- `JobDetailsModal.tsx` - Update to use JobService
- `SavedJobList.tsx` - Update to use JobService

### 2. Follow the Update Pattern
Use the example in `frontend/src/components/EXAMPLE_UPDATE.md` as a guide:

1. Replace legacy imports with new service imports
2. Instantiate the appropriate service class
3. Update function calls to use new service methods
4. Use utility functions for common operations
5. Run tests to verify functionality

### 3. Run Tests Frequently
After updating each component:
```bash
# Run tests for the specific component category
npx playwright test tests/user-profile/

# Or run a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/user-profile/profile-dashboard.test.ts
```

## Medium Term Steps

### 4. Continue with Remaining Components
Once UserProfile and JobSearch components are complete:

#### SkillBank Components
- `SkillBankSelectors.tsx`
- `SkillsSection.tsx`
- `ExperienceSection.tsx`
- `EducationSection.tsx`
- `ProjectsSection.tsx`
- `CertificationsSection.tsx`

#### ResumeBuilder Components
- `ResumeBuilder.tsx`
- `ResumeList.tsx`
- `ResumePreview.tsx`

#### Timeline Components
- `TimelineEventCard.tsx`
- `TimelineModal.tsx`
- `ActivityLog.tsx`

#### Shared/UI Components
- `Header.tsx`
- `StatusPanel.tsx`

### 5. Implement Missing Utility Functions
As you encounter functionality that was in the legacy APIs, implement it in `frontend/src/utils/componentUtils.ts`:
- `calculateProfileCompleteness`
- `validateProfile`
- Any other missing functions

## Long Term Steps

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- Run the full test suite to ensure all components work together
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify responsive design and cross-browser compatibility

### 7. Documentation Updates
- Update component README files if they exist
- Document any deviations from the standard update process
- Create guidelines for future component updates

### 8. Final Validation
- Run all tests one final time
- Verify TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Confirm all checklist items are complete in `tsx_update_checklist.md`

## Key Resources

### Documentation
- `FRONTEND_UPDATE_COMPLETE_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - Complete overview of what's been done
- `frontend_update_strategy.md` - Overall approach and principles
- `tsx_update_checklist.md` - Detailed checklist for tracking progress
- `playwright_testing_approach.md` - Testing approach and guidelines

### Code Examples
- `frontend/src/components/EXAMPLE_UPDATE.md` - Example of how to update a component
- `frontend/src/utils/componentUtils.ts` - Utility functions
- `frontend/e2e/pages/UserProfilePage.ts` - Page object example
- `frontend/e2e/tests/user-profile/profile-dashboard.test.ts` - Test example

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests safely with timeout
npm run test:e2e:safe

# Run tests for specific category
npx playwright test tests/user-profile/
```

## Success Criteria
Before moving to the next phase, ensure:
✅ All UserProfile components are updated and tests pass
✅ All JobSearch components are updated and tests pass
✅ No references to legacy API modules remain
✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
✅ All checklist items for completed components are marked as done

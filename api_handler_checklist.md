# API Handler Implementation Checklist

This checklist outlines the steps required to implement a complete backend API handler using FastAPI for the JobPilot application. The API should expose all CRUD operations defined by the data model.

## Project Structure Setup

- [x] Create new API directory structure under `backend/api/`
- [x] Set up main application file (`main.py`) with FastAPI instance
- [x] Configure middleware (CORS, logging, error handling)
- [x] Set up API router structure with proper prefixes and tags
- [x] Configure dependency injection for database repositories
- [x] Set up environment configuration and secret management
- [x] Configure API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## Authentication & Authorization

- [x] Implement user authentication system (JWT tokens)
- [x] Create middleware for token validation
- [x] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if needed
- [x] Add authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh token)
- [x] Implement API key authentication for external integrations
- [ ] TODO: Implement AWS Cognito integration (configurable auth provider)

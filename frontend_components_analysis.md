# Frontend Components and Behaviors for Playwright MCP Validation

## Component Structure Overview

The JobPilot frontend is organized into the following structure:

1. **Pages**:
   - ResumeBuilderPage (root path '/')
   - JobSearchPage ('/jobs')

2. **Resume Builder Tabs**:
   - UserProfileTab
   - ResumeTab
   - SkillBankTab

3. **Job Search Tabs**:
   - JobsTab
   - ApplicationsTab
   - LeadsTab

4. **Shared Components**:
   - ActivityLog

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Responsive Design
- Mobile viewport rendering (375x667)
- Tablet viewport rendering (768x1024)
- Desktop viewport rendering (1280x800)
- Touch interaction support
- Adaptive layout changes

### Browser Compatibility
- Chromium/Chrome rendering
- Firefox rendering
- WebKit/Safari rendering

## Test Data Requirements

### Mock Data Scenarios
1. **Empty State**: No data available for display
2. **Partial Data**: Some data fields populated, others empty
3. **Complete Data**: All data fields populated with realistic values
4. **Error State**: API errors or invalid data responses
5. **Edge Cases**: Boundary values, special characters, large data sets

## Integration Points

### API Integration
- Backend API endpoint responses
- Authentication flow (if applicable)
- Data CRUD operations
- Error response handling

### Service Integration
- Local storage interactions (if applicable)
- Browser storage usage (if applicable)
- Third-party service integrations (if applicable)

This comprehensive list of components and behaviors provides a foundation for developing Playwright tests that validate the frontend functionality of the JobPilot application.

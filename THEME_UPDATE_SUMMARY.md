     `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'business');`
   - Removed the localStorage theme initialization code

3. **Configured Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI**
   - Created tailwind.config.ts with business theme as the only available theme
   - Updated index.css to explicitly set the business theme using proper CSS custom property syntax

4. **Cleaned Up Unused Code**

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx` - Removed theme selector dropdown
- `frontend/src/main.tsx` - Set business theme as default
- `frontend/src/index.css` - Added CSS custom property for business theme
- `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` - Created new config file with only business theme

## Testing
The application now uses the DaisyUI 'business' theme as the default and only theme. All theme selector functionality has been removed, simplifying the user interface while maintaining a professional appearance. The business theme provides a clean, professional look with a blue and gray color scheme that's appropriate for a business application.

# Frontend Component Update Strategy

## Objective
Update all frontend TSX components to integrate with the new service layer (UserProfileService, JobService, SkillBankService, etc.) without maintaining legacy API compatibility. This approach reduces complexity and aligns the frontend with the current backend API structure.

## High-Level Approach

### 1. Systematic Component Analysis
- Identify all components importing legacy API modules (`userProfileApi`, `jobApi`, `skillBankApi`)
- Categorize components by functionality (UserProfile, Job Search, Skill Bank, etc.)
- Document current usage patterns and dependencies

### 2. Playwright Testing Setup
- Install and configure Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Create baseline tests that document current component behavior
- Set up test infrastructure and utilities
- Verify testing environment works correctly

### 3. Service Integration
- Replace legacy API imports with new service class imports
- Instantiate appropriate service classes in each component
- Adapt component logic to use new service method signatures
- Update TypeScript types to match new service interfaces

### 4. Missing Functionality Implementation
- Identify utility functions that were part of legacy APIs
- Reimplement these as standalone utility functions or add to appropriate services
- Examples: `calculateCompleteness`, `formatSalaryRange`, `validateProfile`

### 5. Component-by-Component Updates
- Update components in functional groups (UserProfile, Job Search, etc.)
- Use Playwright tests to verify functionality after each update
- Maintain consistent patterns across all components

### 6. Validation and Testing
- Run complete test suite to ensure all functionality works
- Test error handling and loading states
- Confirm TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Validate responsive design and UI consistency

## Key Principles

### No Legacy Support
- Completely remove references to legacy API modules
- Do not create adapter layers or compatibility functions
- Accept that existing mock data will be replaced with new service integration

### Direct Service Integration
- Components directly instantiate and use service classes
- No intermediate layers or complex dependency injection
- Services handle all HTTP communication with backend

### Consistent Patterns
- Use the same instantiation pattern across all components
- Maintain consistent error handling and loading state management
- Follow Solid.js best practices for reactive state management

### Type Safety
- Ensure all component props and state match service interfaces
- Use TypeScript to catch integration issues at compile time
- Update any custom types to align with service definitions

### Test-Driven Development
- Create baseline tests before updating components
- Use tests to guide refactoring process
- Verify functionality with tests after each change
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage throughout the process

## Update Sequence

1. **Playwright Testing Setup** - Establish testing infrastructure
2. **UserProfile Components** - Core user functionality
3. **Job Search Components** - Primary application feature
4. **Skill Bank Components** - Resume building foundation
5. **Resume Builder Components** - Main application feature
6. **Timeline Components** - Activity tracking features
7. **Shared/UI Components** - Common interface elements

## Success Criteria

- All components successfully compile with TypeScript
- All components render correctly with service integration
- All user interactions work as expected
- No references to legacy API modules remain
- Consistent error handling and loading states across components
- Clean, maintainable code that follows established patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage with Playwright
- All tests pass with the updated components

This strategy ensures a clean break from legacy dependencies while maintaining all existing functionality through direct integration with the new service layer.

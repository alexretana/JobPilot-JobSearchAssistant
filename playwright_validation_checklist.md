# Playwright MCP Validation Checklist for Frontend Components

## Overview
This checklist provides a structured approach to validate frontend components using Playwright MCP. The validation is organized by sections to prevent context overflow and allow focused testing.

For a detailed analysis of components and behaviors that need validation, see [frontend_components_analysis.md](frontend_components_analysis.md).

## Prerequisites
Before running any tests, ensure the development servers are running:

### Starting the Servers
Use the recommended approach from the project documentation:

1. **Windows (Recommended):**
   ```cmd
   start_dev_servers.bat
   ```

2. **Cross-Platform Alternative (Python script - most reliable):**
   ```bash
   python run_dev_servers.py
   ```

3. **Cross-Platform Alternative (Batch/Shell scripts):**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   run_all.bat --subprocess
   
   # Linux/Mac
   ./run_all.sh --subprocess
   ```

### Verifying Server Status
After starting the servers, verify they are running:

1. Backend should be accessible at: http://localhost:8000
2. Frontend should be accessible at: http://localhost:3000

You can use these commands to check:
```bash
# Check backend
curl -I http://localhost:8000

# Check frontend
curl -I http://localhost:3000
```

## Running Playwright Tests

### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
cd frontend && npx playwright test

# Run tests for a specific section
cd frontend && npx playwright test tests/resume-builder/

# Run tests in headed mode
cd frontend && npx playwright test --headed

# Run tests with trace viewer
cd frontend && npx playwright test --trace on

# Run tests with UI mode
cd frontend && npx playwright test --ui
```

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npx playwright install
   ```

3. Verify Playwright installation:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npx playwright test --version
   ```

## Test Development Guidelines

### Test Structure
1. Use Page Object Model for component interactions
2. Create separate test files for each component
3. Group related tests in describe blocks
4. Use meaningful test descriptions
5. Include both positive and negative test cases

### Mock Data Strategy
1. Create consistent mock data for predictable tests
2. Use different data scenarios (empty, partial, complete)
3. Include error scenarios and edge cases
4. Maintain mock data consistency across tests

### Reporting
1. Generate HTML reports after test runs
2. Capture screenshots on test failures
3. Record videos for complex interactions
4. Track test execution times
5. Monitor test coverage metrics

## Validation Completion Criteria

## Run Script Analysis and Recommendations

### Script Quality Assessment

#### Good Scripts (Recommended for Use):
1. **run_dev_servers.py** - Most robust implementation with:
   - Proper process management
   - Health checks using actual HTTP requests
   - Graceful shutdown with signal handlers
   - Error handling for process failures
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Clear status feedback

2. **run_all.bat / run_all.sh** - Good cross-platform scripts with:
   - Support for both foreground and subprocess modes
   - Proper cleanup mechanisms for subprocesses
   - Signal handlers in shell version for graceful shutdown

3. **start_dev_servers.bat / stop_dev_servers.bat** - Functional Windows-specific scripts:
   - Simple and direct approach for Windows users
   - Basic health checks
   - Clear user instructions

#### Scripts with Limitations:
1. **start_dev_servers.bat** - Has a fixed 15-second timeout which might not be enough for slower machines
2. **stop_dev_servers.bat** - Relies on window titles which may not be reliable if they change

### Recommendations for Server Startup in Playwright Testing

1. **Primary Recommendation**: Use `run_dev_servers.py` for the most reliable server management during testing
2. **Windows Alternative**: Use `start_dev_servers.bat` for quick Windows-based testing
3. **Cross-Platform Alternative**: Use `run_all.bat --subprocess` or `./run_all.sh --subprocess` for cross-platform compatibility
4. **Validation Process**: Always verify servers are running before executing Playwright tests by checking HTTP responses from both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 3000)

# JobPilot Frontend Implementation Checklist

## Getting Started

Before beginning the implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Read the Design Document**: Carefully read through the `FRONTEND_DESIGN_DOC.md` to understand the layout, components, and functionality required.
2. **Review Package Dependencies**: Check `frontend/package.json` to understand the packages we'll be using:
   - `solid-js` - The core framework for building the UI
   - `tailwindcss` v4 - For styling the application
   - `daisyui` v5 - For pre-built UI components that align with Tailwind
3. **Research Documentation**: Use the Context7 MCP tool to look up documentation for the main packages:
   - SolidJS: `/websites/solidjs`
   - Tailwind CSS: `/websites/tailwindcss`
   - daisyUI: `/llmstxt/daisyui-llms.txt`

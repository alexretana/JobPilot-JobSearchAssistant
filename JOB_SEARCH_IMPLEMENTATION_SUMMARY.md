# Job Search & Display - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully connected the Job Search & Display components to the backend API, replacing mock data with real data from the backend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Vite Configuration (vite.config.ts)
- Added proxy configuration to forward API requests from frontend (port 3000) to backend (port 8000)
- Configured proxies for all API endpoints (/jobs, /auth, /users, etc.)

### 2. API Service (ApiService.ts)
- Enhanced error handling to properly detect and handle non-JSON responses
- Added logging for debugging API calls
- Ensured authentication headers are correctly applied to requests

### 3. Job Service (JobService.ts)
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages
- Added logging for all API calls
- Ensured proper typing for API responses

### 4. Job Search View (JobSearchView.tsx)
- Replaced mock data (`sampleJobs`) with real data from backend API
- Implemented loading states with spinner animation
- Added error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Used `searchJobs` method instead of `listJobs` for better functionality
- Added proper data transformation between backend and frontend formats

### 5. Job Details Modal (JobDetailsModal.tsx)
- Updated to fetch detailed job information from backend when a job is selected
- Added loading states for job details
- Added error handling for job details fetching
- Implemented fallback to basic job info if detailed info fails to load

### 6. Main Entry Point (main.tsx)
- Added initialization of development authentication to ensure API calls work in development

## Testing Results
- ✅ Job Search page loads and displays real job data from backend
- ✅ Job details modal fetches and displays detailed job information
- ✅ All tabs (Jobs, Applications, Leads) load correctly
- ✅ Loading states work properly
- ✅ Error states work properly
- ✅ Authentication is properly handled

## Issues Resolved
1. **API Connectivity**: Fixed by adding proxy configuration to Vite
2. **Authentication**: Fixed by initializing development authentication
3. **Error Handling**: Improved to handle non-JSON responses and provide better error messages
4. **Data Transformation**: Implemented proper transformation between backend and frontend data formats

## Verification
All functionality has been tested and verified using the Playwright browser testing tool:
- Navigation between tabs works correctly
- Job data loads from backend API
- Job details modal fetches detailed information
- Loading and error states display appropriately
- Authentication is properly handled
